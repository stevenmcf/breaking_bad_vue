# Vue Application with Requests

### Learning Objectives

- Be able to create a multi-component web application, with Vue
- Be able to make API requests to load JSON data into your application

## Brief

Create an application that makes a request to an API and displays the data.

### MVP

- The application should display data from an API request.
- The application should have a clear separation of concerns (multiple components)
- Take input from the user to update the page. You could update the page by filtering or manipulating the data on user interaction, or you might make further API requests to load more data that is then displayed.

## Planning

- Look at the JSON you are going to be loading into your app and based on the data, draw a wireframe
- Start by loading the data from the API into your application and checking that it has loaded, before doing any work on the views
- Plan your components and draw a diagram of the data flow through the application
